The farm will be up to 10 acres in size with farm buildings that we can convert into holiday homes (or have existing ones) so that we can semi retire and live off the income from the rentals.  We will be aiming for a dog friendly establishment and will create paths and scented trails, have agility equipment and an outside dog shower.  The place will be a haven for dogs and their owners.

If we had managed to move to wales we might go on holiday in Cornwall with them as we had many lovely holidays down there when they were younger. We would stay in a lovely cottage somewhere like Hayle as its not as busy as St Ives and the beaches are more dog friendly there.  We never holiday without the dogs so we have to choose a cottage carefully to meet their needs and the needs of our girls, who like to go out and be independent from us without having to drive for miles. We would spent time together revisiting old haunts that would include spending time on the beach, exploring by train, visiting St Ives, art galleries, costal path walking and shopping.  
If we were still living in London we would probably holiday in north wales and spend time exploring the hills and countryside and all the lovely little villages.
As the girls are grown up they would probably only want to take a weeks leave so it would be a fairly short holiday.","This is a bit of a stretch to imagine as we dont have parties at our house.  Our house is too cluttered with old belongings my husband has hoarded over the years.  Plus its also got way too much dog hair everywhere and would need a really good clean to try and get rid of that.  If we did have a party it would take a lot of planning.  We would need to declutter the house, clean it, find somewhere for the dogs to go for the evening as they would only get in the way.  Work out what food and drink to provide then go and buy it all.  If the weather was good it would be great to be out in the garden so that would need a tidy too.

Hooray. Still, house parties are the best parties. I'll fire up the Xbox and get fired up on liquor, and my friends and I can briefly time-travel back to 2014 when things seemed to make more sense. In retrospect, that was probably because I wasn't financially independent at the time. I'm sure in the run-up to the party I'll be attacked by social anxiety and want to cancel.
